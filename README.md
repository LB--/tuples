tuples [![Build Status](https://webapi.biicode.com/v1/badges/LB/LB/tuples/master)](https://www.biicode.com/LB/tuples)
======

Tuples are useful for acting as arrays of types in template metaprogramming, often called type vectors. This library has boilerplate code for dealing with tuples at compile-time and also some utility functions.

*This library requires that your compiler support C++1z (the C++ standard _after_ C++14)*
